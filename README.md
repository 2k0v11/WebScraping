# WebScraping

#### Welcome to my web scraping project!
I've been exploring data extraction from Amazon review pages and LinkedIn profiles. By gathering customer reviews and ratings from Amazon, I gained insights into product trends and user satisfaction. I tried to apply Sentimental analysis to the extracted data using the VADER(Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner) tool.
Additionally, Scraping LinkedIn profiles helped me understand job market trends and skill requirements, benefiting job seekers and recruiters alike. Overcoming technical challenges has sharpened my programming and problem-solving skills. I'm excited to keep refining this project repository and harnessing data to make informed decisions in our data-driven world!
