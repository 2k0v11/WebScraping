# WebScrapping

### Welcome to my web scraping project! I've been exploring data extraction from Amazon review pages and LinkedIn profiles. By gathering customer reviews and ratings from Amazon, I gain insights into product trends and user satisfaction. Additionally, scraping LinkedIn profiles helps me understand job market trends and skill requirements, benefiting job seekers and recruiters alike. Overcoming technical challenges has sharpened my programming and problem-solving skills. I'm excited to keep refining this project and harnessing data to make informed decisions in our data-driven world!
