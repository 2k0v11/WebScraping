              " <span>After using Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra for quite a bit as a daily driver and coming back to Samsung after a long time after using other smaller form factor phones like ONEPLUS 9, here's what I think about this phone.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/><br/>- This phone has the best camera ever installed into a smartphone, hands-down! No other phone made in human history can ever come close to 1% of what Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra's cameras can do.<br/><br/>- Performance is crazy! Not only it has Snapdragon 8Gen-2, but that too custom-made for Samsung Galaxy phones. You can play any games, run any apps and do whatever you'd want from a phone that is used at work, gaming, taking photos/videos and for personal use at the same time.<br/><br/>- Rectangular form factor of this phone makes it so much comfortable and easy to hold. And it looks very premium too, which obviously is expected from a phone that costs this much.<br/><br/>- OneUI has so many great features that they cannot be listed in one place. It brings a whole new meaning to \"smart\" in smartphones. Previously only Apple was making real smartphones that were actually smart and now with OneUI 5.1, Samsung has joined the league and probably done a better job than Apple at this point.<br/><br/>- Good Lock modules + OneUI 5.1 has such a tremendous level of customization in terms of many aspects of the usability. It doesn't have all of it, to which I'll come in \"CONS\" section.<br/><br/>- Charging time is good, reverse charging and wireless charging are such a sweet add-on that helps and makes the experience really good.<br/><br/>- S-Pen does the wonders! Very useful specially for those who use their phone for professional work like eSigning and other precision work.<br/><br/>- Build quality and software are really premium, you'll know you've sold a kidney when you hold this phone in your hands and turn up the max resolution on display.<br/><br/>- S23 Ultra is slightly more flat on sides as compared to S22 Ultra which makes it a more usable phone.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/><br/>- Now, since this phone has a curved display which adds no usability but makes it little difficult to use for people with smaller hands or to reach to corners with one hand, it becomes little hard to get used to this kind of display even if you've used a curved display phone with smaller form factor before because S23 Ultra is HUGE!<br/><br/>- Another issue with curved screen, since there's a decent curve in screen, finding a screen protector is really hard! Tempered glasses don't fit well, they get spaced by covers/cases, Samsung officially doesn't make tempered glass for S23 Ultra. Samsung sells a thin membrane sheet for ₹1,500/- which has a cutout for camera and collects dust. Having no screen protection means having your second kidney at risk too!<br/><br/>- No charger in the box (ugh) and the cable that comes with it is really flimsy. Doesn't look like it came with a flagship phone. ONEPLUS makes 10x better cables so better buy one from them.<br/><br/>- A phone this expensive should have all the necessary features right? But the OneUI 5.1 doesn't come with an app lock. Samsung Secure Folder is nice but not usable for a day-to-day use. Secure Folder is fine for hiding images and apps but not convenient for daily access. There's no Good Lock module to have app lock either.<br/><br/>- OneUI 5.1 (unlike many other UIs like OxygenOS 13 and ColorOS 13) doesn't give option to rename apps in app drawer. Ability to use 3rd party icon packs just came recently. And installing a 3rd party launcher kind of ruins the UI for recent apps screen.<br/><br/>- OneUI 5.1 requires installation of a 3rd party Good Lock module to even configure what icons will appear on your navigation bar.<br/><br/>- Overall this is a really good phone, best I'd say! But OneUI 5.1 lacks some basic features which should've been implemented.<br/><br/>- But other than these minor software issues and some hardware inconveniences, this phone is definitely a recommendation.</span>\n",

              " <span>This phone is a pefect upgrade from my old One plus. I had to make a hard choice between s22 and s23. I came to the conclusion that processor used in s22 (Snapdragon 8 gen 1) is inefficient. Infact it was one of the most inefficient processors produced by snapdragon+samsung in last 5 years in premium segment. That combined with low battery was just worse. So I decided to spend more money for this phone. Snapdragon 8 gen 2 is an actual successor of snapdragon and gives enormous battery life.<br/><br/>After first charge, I was getting 8 hours SOT. Which is double from my old Oppo Oneplus (Haha). Plus I got upgrade on the first day, using 120 hz refresh rate with light performance mode while battery set to adaptive. I think I can push for 10 hour screen-on-time if I want to.<br/><br/>Screen is perfect, samsung right now is the biggest supplier of screens in mobile market, so that's no doubt. Speakers are stereo and have dolby digital mode. The UI is top tier, samsung right now has the best UI in the market. The amazing things is the bloatware are so well integrated into samsung ecosystem that it doesn't even feel like bloatware. I am using samsung internet/notes instead of chrome and google keep. There is also a vapor chamber in base variant of s23, which you will not find in s22. Ram booster was turned on by default, giving me 8 GB of virtual RAM but I turned it off because I heard it reduces performance. All medium-end games run at 120 FPS, and samsung has their own app for real time monitoring. You will also get 6 months spotify premium (from Amazon) and 4 months of youtube premium (from samsung) with this.<br/><br/>I use spigen ultra hybrid case with Glazedinc tempered glass. Protip - Glazedinc.com tempered glass is compatiable with fingerprint sensor. I use their s23 tempered glass-real curved which works perfectly and costed me around ₹675 (not sponsored).<br/><br/>Phone is expensive and price should be set around 65K, but samsung is trying to become apple of android world. Whats worse is discount is there, but they will not give it to you directly, you have to use 3 different discounts to lower the MRP which is a scummy behaviour from Samsung. No reason to give additional 7K exchange bonus, if MRP itself was lowered by 7K. Also bank credit card discount are insane (around 8K). This will bring MRP in the range of 60K instead of 75K. My point is to give discount directly instead of bypassing it from somewhere. Also availing warranties and sales after service is bad, I still have to manually find out about youtube premium membership because samsung never mentioned it anywhere.<br/><br/>So, this is the best phone is premium segment apart from s23 ultra. If you are looking for a handy premium smartphone and can't manage big screen on s23 ultra, this is the way to go.<br/><br/>Edit 1. People should not use Samsung Smart switch to restore their data to new phone. I have heard it reduces battery life. Instead manually copy photos, contacts everything etc.<br/><br/>Edit 2. Moonshots on higher model i.e. s23 ultra are kinda fake since it uses ai scene optimizer to place a picture of moon on real moon. But nothing to worry about this model.<br/><br/>Edit 3. Don't use samsung smart switch to transfer files to your new phone. It is bugged and keeps draining battery. Manually transfer big files. If you had used it, you can factory reset your phone if you notice your battery life is not up to the mark. I didn't use smart switch and easily got 8 hours.</span>\n",

It's been super smooth and I've received a lot of compliments for my photos (Hey maybe that's also some part due to my skill, yes?).<br/><br/>But the phone has a great battery life, quite often I'd come back home with around 50% battery (with BT and Loc on).  Mostly not with Power Saver on, but I did keep it on on some days initially.<br/><br/>I hardly use the S-pen, mostly due to no habit, but it seems a cool addition for those with smaller hands. For me, I have giant Hands, so i can easily use the entire phone with my two hands.<br/><br/>I would recommend this phone if you are looking for a premium product.

The phone takes around 1hr 15 mins to charge when using a 20 watt power adapter.Other aspects of the phone are also superb, like camera, smoothness of the UI. I hope Samsung doesn’t mess that up with software updates.PS: I am using the Ringke Fusion-X  case with the phone.',\n",
              " 'All are good.I m not satisfied with front camera.One more thing is that there is a heating issue whenever use Camara apps and data over mobile network.',\n",
              " 'I loved it. Before this Phone, I was using Samsung Galaxy FE 20 which is having heating and battery issues.I upgraded to this phone and everything is fantastic, with superior camera quality.The only missing thing was a charger.',\n",
              " \"This phone is a pefect upgrade from my old One plus. I had to make a hard choice between s22 and s23. I came to the conclusion that processor used in s22 (Snapdragon 8 gen 1) is inefficient. Infact it was one of the most inefficient processors produced by snapdragon+samsung in last 5 years in premium segment. That combined with low battery was just worse. So I decided to spend more money for this phone. Snapdragon 8 gen 2 is an actual successor of snapdragon and gives enormous battery life.After first charge, I was getting 8 hours SOT. Which is double from my old Oppo Oneplus (Haha). Plus I got upgrade on the first day, using 120 hz refresh rate with light performance mode while battery set to adaptive. I think I can push for 10 hour screen-on-time if I want to.Screen is perfect, samsung right now is the biggest supplier of screens in mobile market, so that's no doubt. Speakers are stereo and have dolby digital mode. The UI is top tier, samsung right now has the best UI in the market. The amazing things is the bloatware are so well integrated into samsung ecosystem that it doesn't even feel like bloatware. I am using samsung internet/notes instead of chrome and google keep. There is also a vapor chamber in base variant of s23, which you will not find in s22. Ram booster was turned on by default, giving me 8 GB of virtual RAM but I turned it off because I heard it reduces performance. All medium-end games run at 120 FPS, and samsung has their own app for real time monitoring. You will also get 6 months spotify premium (from Amazon) and 4 months of youtube premium (from samsung) with this.I use spigen ultra hybrid case with Glazedinc tempered glass. Protip - Glazedinc.com tempered glass is compatiable with fingerprint sensor. I use their s23 tempered glass-real curved which works perfectly and costed me around ₹675 (not sponsored).Phone is expensive and price should be set around 65K, but samsung is trying to become apple of android world. Whats worse is discount is there, but they will not give it to you directly, you have to use 3 different discounts to lower the MRP which is a scummy behaviour from Samsung. No reason to give additional 7K exchange bonus, if MRP itself was lowered by 7K. Also bank credit card discount are insane (around 8K). This will bring MRP in the range of 60K instead of 75K. My point is to give discount directly instead of bypassing it from somewhere. Also availing warranties and sales after service is bad, I still have to manually find out about youtube premium membership because samsung never mentioned it anywhere.So, this is the best phone is premium segment apart from s23 ultra. If you are looking for a handy premium smartphone and can't manage big screen on s23 ultra, this is the way to go.Edit 1. People should not use Samsung Smart switch to restore their data to new phone. I have heard it reduces battery life. Instead manually copy photos, contacts everything etc.Edit 2. Moonshots on higher model i.e. s23 ultra are kinda fake since it uses ai scene optimizer to place a picture of moon on real moon. But nothing to worry about this model.Edit 3. Don't use samsung smart switch to transfer files to your new phone. It is bugged and keeps draining battery. Manually transfer big files. If you had used it, you can factory reset your phone if you notice your battery life is not up to the mark. I didn't use smart switch and easily got 8 hours.\",\n",
              " \"I got this phone just before making an international Trip. The phone served me really well. It's been super smooth and I've received a lot of compliments for my photos (Hey maybe that's also some part due to my skill, yes?).But the phone has a great battery life, quite often I'd come back home with around 50% battery (with BT and Loc on).  Mostly not with Power Saver on, but I did keep it on on some days initially.I hardly use the S-pen, mostly due to no habit, but it seems a cool addition for those with smaller hands. For me, I have giant Hands, so i can easily use the entire phone with my two hands.I would recommend this phone if you are looking for a premium product. The specifications obviously show a significant difference between the Ultra and the normal Samsung S23.\",\n",
